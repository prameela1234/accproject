Every day is a new day as I look forward to my tryst with nature. I find myself reaching for my walking shoes with a childlike joy. This habit of mine started as leisure strolls in the neighborhood with my 2 year old strapped in a stroller. That was some 15 years ago. Since then I have been on a roll, thanks to my walking partners - friends, and family and above all love for nature.It is sad that people are so caught up in the daily rut they forget to acknowledge simple gifts of life. More and more people are walking away from nature than walking in it. Studies have proved that walking outdoors is a big stress-buster. Thirty minutes of daily walk is said to have immense effect on people\u2019s stress and increases their productivity.','http://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/14-walking-workouts-burn-fat-and-boost-energy','http://ak5.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/121903/preview/stock-footage-walking-lightbulb.jpg')
INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(1,'Green Tea ','2014-05-10','If memory serves me right, I took the first sip of green tea about 7 years back at my friend\u0092s house, and it stayed with me as a habit since then. In the earlier days, I made a conscious effort to have it as part of my daily routine, especially in winters. This practice of mine ensued from the awareness of numerous health benefits from all kinds of media, that this simple drink had to offer. Soon enough:      I envisioned my centenarian self a few decades from now, who would dedicate the secret of her prolonged life span to the super food called the \u0091Green Tea\u0092. I might even enter the \u0091Guinness Book of World Records\u0092 for the oldest woman alive!     I also started dreaming of shedding pounds from around my never-budging and ever-bulging waistline, because green tea is supposed to be a great fat burner and it even improves metabolism. In reality, my sunken cheeks are true testimonials to its fat burning abilities!!     I imagined myself disease free forever sans diabetes and hypertension, thanks to the antioxidants in the green tea that would put up a fight befitting a warrior, to prevent cell damage\u0085Yay!  I also realized not too late that you really don\u0092t care about the benefits or the glorified stories of any food when it is part of your life, like your family members :) I am glad to notice that it has taken a place in the hearts of my 17-year old as well as my husband. I for one, savor green tea not for any  specific intent, but for its refreshing aroma and earthy tone. It connects me to the basics, and reminds me where I come from.  It has an unassuming quality with only goodness to offer.  I also like green tea for the fact that it is light in the stomach, almost like water.  205','http://www.soulkuest.wordpress.com','http://www.nashvillescene.com/imager/tea-for-two-green-tea-in-nashville/b/original/1481520/3f37/green-tea1.jpg')
INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(2,'Optimism!!','2014-04-28','This saying comes to mind when I see pessimistic people blaming their bad luck that for some reason finds a way into their lives at every beck and call. Why is it that some people are more inclined to think negative than being optimistic. Is it easy to cultivate a positive outlook in life?  Is it nature or nurture or both? Well, I think both. As with any trait, we can certainly condition our mind to think positive and take responsibility of our actions and situations and move on without playing the blame game.  Optimism, by itself is a passive quality that cannot come into fruition unless coupled with result-yielding qualities like hard work, perseverance and determination. It is a catalyst that adds to the quality of any endeavor you undertake. The usage of this word seems very clich\u00e9d, but one doesn\u0092t realize the power in approaching anything in life with a sense of boundless energy created in positive light. Look at it this way, what has to happen and what will happen is not going to change by the way you react to it. So, why not cultivate the habit of being in a state of mind that is more congenial to your well-being. Yes, believe it or not, it is the way we think, more often than not, that can doom or save our life, rather than the real situation we are in.  We often give things a negative connotation or a distorted image due to our unrealistic expectations of how things should work from the framework of fairness set by us. And we brood and we grumble on how things have not worked as planned and spread a wave of dissatisfaction and pessimism that further hamper our chances on future accomplishments. The vicious cycle continues and the victim is in the whirlpool of constant anger and discontent.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/look-inside/optimism-look-inside/','http://momasaurus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pink-Sun-Flowers-Vintage-HD.jpg')

A shoe on the curbside cast away, forlorn, neglected. Just a single shoe without its pair.\u000a The sight brought a sudden knot to my throat as thoughts not very pleasant crossed my mind. \u000aCould it have been from an accident where the shoe of the victim was thrown mercilessly off its owner, or could it be that it flew off from behind a speeding truck where memories are packed as part of a moving venture, or may be a lonesome side-walker had to desert it in an attempt to run away from a predator.\u000a Whatever it was, the sight of the lonely shoe brought eerie and discomforting thoughts.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/the-shoe/','https://aimeeherman.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/grey-patterns.jpg')
INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(4,'Conscience!',NULL,'Our conscience as a human race has come at crossroads with restlessness ruling the world, with constant friction between countries, between religions and castes, between races, and people coming at loggerheads at the drop of a needle. And for the shameless, lackadaisical attitude that turns a deaf ear and blind eye for all the injustice around us, we should rather be shameful. Sure enough, we have failed conscience!  One way we could bring more sanity to the war stricken minds that are more united in their hostility than love, is to teach the values of tolerance, compassion and harmony. It all starts from home, where we need to sow the seeds of righteousness in young minds from a very early age and be role models ourselves. If only educational institutions incorporated in its curriculum an agenda for awareness in our society to look beyond the differences of nations, color, creed or sex, a new generation of human race could evolve. If only places of worship became abode of enlightenment for altruism and selflessness and pure growth of inner self, rather than breeding grounds for shallowness, pretense and vulgar display of power and influence. If there were to be more holistic treatment of stress at work place that emphasizes on a healthy work-life balance, we would have less of machine-like humans. Even when we have the right tools for spiritual enrichment like the practice of yoga, meditation, and umpteen outlets for emotional catharsis, we fail to put them to right use. For us, peace is just a 5-letter word whose symbol we proudly flaunt on our shirts .It is time we took care of the inferno in the human minds that could consume the entire human race in its blaze than the most powerful nuclear weapon.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/conscience-2/','http://pjentoft.com/buddaglo.jpg')

Wouldn\u0092t you rather be in a place where you tried, no matter you succeeded or not, than in a place where you always have been-where there is no growth in terms of experience, perspective and understanding. \u0095 When something seems more challenging, do not fear and hold yourself back. \u0095 Stick with people who believe in you and help you reach the goal. \u0095 Break up your final goal into small chunks and strive for the immediate goal than taking the big leap that might end in a deadly fall. It could be anything like losing weight, or help for a cause, or write a book, or trek the Himalayas!! \u0095 Don\u0092t pay heed to naysayers. Keep away from them. \u0095 And to the little voice in your head that says not to go there because danger lurks, remember it is your alter ego that is too comfortable with being in the little box you call world and deny there is something outside of it. \u0095 Whenever you feel fear in your gut about any challenge, take it as a good sign and encounter it, for you would come out a new person after it is all over.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/self-doubt/','http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/363/7/6/self_doubt_by_kurtisthesnivy-d6zziks.png')
INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(10,'Banana Bread',NULL,'The ripe bananas with their blackened peel sit on the kitchen counter top, eying at me as if eager to go on their destined trip to the blender. Usually that\u0092s where they all end up, in my smoothie blender, sometimes in the good company of strawberries or blueberries or anything that is labeled healthy, to meet the daily requirement of fruit servings for my kids.  This time around, I decided to take the bananas on a surprise trip to the oven, instead. Yes, the banana cake or banana bread recipe is something I resort to as a form of indulgence. But I personally lean more towards banana bread for its healthy ingredient list. The ummph so exploding aroma of freshly baked banana bread, hot and soft,  is heavenly. I only see them come out of the oven and vanish ever so quickly into the ravenous palates of my family.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/banana-bread/','http://soulkuest.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/2014-03-16-20-06-01.jpg')

Add yeast mixed with warm water to the above( I didn\u0092t have yeast, so we added Eno instead). Add flour and  egg to the bowl. Mix for about a minute, till it forms a large ball. Cover it with a clean towel. Let it rest for 10 minutes.  Make small balls and roll them out into circles 2 mm thick and about 6 inch diameter, like roti or tortilla. If it sticks to the rolling pin, dust some flour before rolling. Cut out triangles of 2-inch width at the rim and going into the center of the circle(just like a pizza slice). Roll each piece as in fruit roll-ups starting out from the wider side, and ending at the narrow side. Place on baking sheet and cover. Let rest for another 10 minutes. Brush with melted butter.  Preheat oven to 415 degrees. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. The rolls are done when they turn golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. You can also see the inner layers of the rolls spread to the sides with the heat, as they form nice crescent shapes.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/crescent-rolls/','http://static.tastykitchen.com/recipes/files/2009/08/crescent-rolls.jpg')

Many of them, I know only by face and some I have personally known for years, but they all contribute to the sense of rhythm, that things are going on just the way they should be! Isn\u0092t it queer that we all pass through hundreds of these moments everyday, still seem unaware of them and take them for granted?! These are, in fact the spokes of the wheel  we call LIFE. When I pay no attention, all things of true value go uncelebrated, like cherish my great childhood, relish the bitter sweetness of motherhood or enjoy the journey of womanhood.','http://soulkuest.wordpress.com/category/everything-is-alright/','http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/happy-cheerful-family-mother-baby-kissing-nature-outdoor-laughing-hugging-outdoors-31165407.jpg')
INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(13,'Avocado',NULL,'1. Avocados(also called butter fruit) are an excellent source of healthful fats \u0096 mono saturated fats and a good source of fiber, vitamins and minerals. People with moderately high cholesterol levels showed significant health improvements from avocado intake, according to studies. It is a good source of potassium, which helps to regulate blood pressure.  2. The carotenoids found in avocado are believed to be powerful anti-oxidants that help prevent cancer and heart disease. Its amazing carotenoid diversity as well as the fats are key to its anti-inflammatory properties. They also enhance immune response to infections.  3.  Adding avocado to other vegetables(like in salads) improves the absorption of carotenoids from these foods. As carotenoids are fat soluble, the creamy fat in avocado increases  their bioavailability, as per credible sources.  4. Last but not the least, avocados are considered to be one of the best anti-aging super foods that help reduce wrinkles and aging of skin by boosting collagen formation. The amino acids and carotenoid anti-oxidants help reduce age-spots.  Avocados can be consumed in your daily sandwiches, salads, burritos, tacos or just as it is(if you like the taste!). Pack it in your lunch box as a snack or have it as a complement in your main meal. It is also a value addition to your fruit smoothies.  Long story short, it didn\u0092t take  me too long to travel the path from dislike to love for avocados, especially in guacamole. In fact it has found a major place in my everyday dietary chart, off late.
